This is a Functional LMS with features being added day in day out.
I have primarily used React js for all my front_end need.
to run the front end server, after cloning the repository to your local machine, run the command
: npm start.
make sure you have node js installed on your machine.

For my backend, I used django to create an api to connect my frontend to my database.
I have attached a requirements.txt file. Make sure you have all those installed on your local machine.
After installation,  run the command
: python manage.py runserver

You most likely will run into a database-related error.
Create a database on your local machine in this directory and make all necessary edits in the final/settings.py
that should sort the database issue.

You are done with the setup. Browse away!
For feedback, feel free to reach out through social media links in my github profile.
